    <h3>Part 1: An Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Burger</strong>punk has been described as the aesthetic reconciliation of the post-modernist individual
        recognizing the
        cognitive dissonance between the vast nature of corporate service-based globalization and the individualist
        nature
        of consumption forced upon them by the very nature and propaganda of their capitalist benefactors. The genre's
        backdrop explores the conflict between traditional american sensibilities inflated to a caricature by
        exaggerated
        use of freeway systems, suburban growth, and franchise based food products against the cynical nature of the
        average
        american blooming into a genuine need for individualized and personalized culture after slowly exchanging their
        ancestor's cultural heritage for their own force-fed culture of ease of access and frugality. Issues of
        hopelessness, automation, and complacency contrast the information provided through constant access to media and
        propagandized geopolitical news. The genre itself, becoming a meta commentary on other fantasy or science
        fiction
        based genres by using the actual occurring landscape as the basis for literary escape.</p>

    <p>As a metastatic reorientation of <strong>burger</strong>punk, post-neo-<strong>burger</strong>punk emerged under
        the umbrella of commodification for
        the <strong>burger</strong>punk sensibility in mid-2019. Post-<strong>burger</strong>punk asks questions of the
        object-orientation of the <strong>burger</strong>punk
        School of thought, such as: does object fetishism exist without the physical object? How will the streamlining
        of
        service-oriented positions affect consumer gestalt? Is there life after <strong>burger</strong>punk?</p>

    <p>In post-<strong>burger</strong>punk, the <strong>burger</strong>theorist substitutes the low-quality consumer
        good,
        with all its accompanying
        sense-experience and immediate physical health hazards, with the post-industrial information commodity. Where
        there
        were pimpled minimum-wage fry cooks, there are now rows of sleek touch-interfaced kiosks. Where there were gas
        fumes
        now hums the Tesla roadster. Purely ethereal forms take the place of physical sense-referents. The freeways
        remain,
        but the thrill of driving is minimized. Consumption is retained in intensity, but replaced in its formulation.
    </p>

    <p>The question comes to be: did the object ever matter? And in this sense the informational commodity supersedes
        the
        consumer good. The subscription secures the means of consumption, but the commodity is ever-present for
        consumption.
        All modes exterior to the subject-object, consumer-commodity relation can then be safely expunged.</p>

    <p>It should not be surprising then that the model of continued purchase and return should be replaced by automated
        subscriptions, in order to remove the choice from each forking path in consumption. The consumer need no longer
        to
        even decide yes or no, but only to remain inert within the system of automation. It might be said in the future:
        the
        mobility scooter had to roll, so that the Amazon‚Ñ¢ drone could fly.</p>

    <p>There remains then a contention among the <strong>burger</strong>theorists, either in the traditional
        <strong>burger</strong>punk School, or in the
        more reactionary German Freip√ºnken , of the role of Freeways in the post-<strong>burger</strong>punk world. The
        Freip√ºnk‚Äôs Autobahn
        connection must not be dismissed: the origin of German consumerism rests on the cement of their superhighways.
        The
        Freeway, as a propulsive force for delivery and transaction of consumer goods, does not find easy parallel in
        the
        <strong>burger</strong>theory of tomorrow. And those <strong>burger</strong>theorists who have tried to handwave
        its
        replacement by the Internet, as
        the ‚ÄúInformation Superhighway of Tomorrow‚Äù have been met with more than incidental scorn for their literalisms.
    </p>

    <p>By this time, there were those who scarcely bothered to read the theory, either through hypnosis through the
        social
        aspects of Post-<strong>burger</strong>punk, engendered by a kind of creeping, mass-stimulated orgy of
        consumption,
        or through loss
        of the necessary faculties to understand the text.</p>

    <p>But this brings us to the dimetrical split between the broad strokes of <strong>burger</strong> theory, that of
        the
        european school
        and the american...</p>
