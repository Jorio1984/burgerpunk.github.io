    <h2>üçî - Layer 01: <strong>burger</strong>Punk Midnight</h2>
    <p>Harry rode shotgun. The white sedan flew through the night, past billboards, tall fast food signs, slabs and
        tiers of aging concrete. A soft rust had gathered on the cars&rsquo; wheel wells, the tires were a little flat -
        this was a 2003 Nissan, not too bad on the outside, at most a little beat up, but its interior, where Harry rode
        somewhat uncomfortably, told a different story altogether.<br />
        Harry feet kicked around in the footwell as a schoolboy&rsquo;s would - dangled, more like it - seeing as he
        stood just 5 feet, 11 inches tall.<br />
        Driving was his &ldquo;friend&rdquo;, the one who had picked him up from the midnight roadside an hour earlier,
        who called himself T o d d.<br />
        &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Harry, who had heard that interested-sounding questions would get people to like you
        more.<br />
        &ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; half-replied his best friend ever, more intent on the vape pen dangling from his chapped
        lip than on the dark road ahead of them. This brief reply had taken over a minute to arrive.<br />
        Thin Todd was also a manlet, standing a mere 6 feet 0 inches tall, but, as he had told Harry just after picking
        the young hitchhiker up, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t all be lanklets in this American globohomo <strong>burger</strong>punk reality. In
        fact, little dude, our bodies are shrinking at an alarming rate - by 2100 we&rsquo;ll all be pygmies lil
        duuuude.&rdquo; The Toddman extended a tattooed wrist in explanation - an ink infochart was displayed thereon,
        detailing the falling heights of Americans across the homogoglobe.</p>

    <p>Harry took a second to run his eyes over the tattoo, then got around to the question he&rsquo;d started the
        conversation for the purpose of asking. <br />
        &ldquo;Where did you say we were going again?&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;Welp,&rdquo; answered Thin Todd, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to McVille #321, McState #32, which is
        hereabouts ten hours away, and you said you wanted dropping off at someplace called &ldquo;the
        Ovum.&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;The Ovum,&rdquo; remembered Harry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; </p>

    <p>The word Ovum reminded him of Onion Rings.</p>

    <p>The Ovum was a new-fangled Cosplay convention, sponsored by Onahole and Wendy&rsquo;s. Attendees to the Ovum were
        expected to arrive Completely Nude, which justified for today Harry&rsquo;s complete lack of clothing. Never had
        there been such a hub of degeneracy in the continental United States (which is to say excluding Hawaii and
        goddamn Alaska) - at least not since &lsquo;03, when in New York City the website ebaumsworld was founded in the
        penthouse bedroom of Jeopardy! host Al###e///x Tre(()))((())####&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;b****K.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I DID NOT CONSENT TO THIS!&rdquo; shrieked the dying TV stalwart, loud enough for the author of this text
        to hear him. Harry didn&rsquo;t hear, however, (nor did Thin Todd),and so the action continued as follows with a
        bark from Thin Todd:.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m famished, senpai.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I could use a pickmeup myself,&rdquo; Harry agreed. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s a McDonalds!&rdquo;. He
        pointed as he spoke, extending a childish finger. Harry paused a moment, finger still poised. Something was
        wrong&#8230; Todd should have stopped, or at least veered in the direction of the McD&rsquo;s. Nothing of the
        sort had happened. Harry recognised that the car was not actually and had not been moving. He supposed that
        they&rsquo;d been idling in the restaurant&rsquo;s drive-thru for some time before his almost certainly atheist
        friend had so tactfully made the suggestion.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,&rdquo; Thin Todd scratched his goatee facial &ldquo;beard&rdquo;,
        attempting to place his order.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Take your time, gringo,&rdquo; the girl radioed through for the eighteenth time. A snap of static muffled
        her thick Latino accent.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why not a Junior Bigmac,&rdquo; Harry chimed in, &ldquo;like I ordered?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nah little dude I&rsquo;m six foot, not 5 feet 11 remember&rdquo;<br />
        The Latina drive thru attendant caught wind of this admission, and a great roar of Chihuahuan laughter could be
        heard through the radio set.</p>

    <p> &ldquo;Hehe&rdquo; chucked Harry. &ldquo;I hate long goodbyes. How do we do this?&rdquo; </p>

    <p>Thin Todd hid his face in embarrassment. He exited the drive-thru line, merging back into traffic, toward the
        highway, and a view of Cultural Revolution &#20154;&#27402; Human Rights &#27665;&#36939; Democratization

        Yes<br />
        YES<br />
        The mysterious billboard rolled away slowly, until it appeared to be miles and miles off - standing over a more
        polluted part of town, though the distinction was hard to make.<br />
        &ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; said Thin Todd, breaking Harry&rsquo;s focus on the oriental mystery, &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t
        ever leaving this town.&rdquo;<br />
        Thin Todd&rsquo;s absent heuristic would prove true, truer than anything the borderline invalid had said in his
        23 prior years of life.<br />
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a place we can eat!&rdquo; said Harry.</p>

    <p>It was a Wendy&rsquo;s. Harry was back in Wendy&rsquo;s - the megacorp&rsquo;s sponsorship of the Ovum had reeled
        in yet another gullible Cosplayer. Nowadays any eaterie whose logo hadn&rsquo;t been featured in sponsored spots
        no longer registered as such in Harry&rsquo;s mind. If you&rsquo;d walked into an Italian place he&rsquo;d have
        been surprised to find a pizza there. If you&rsquo;d sat down and ordered you&rsquo;d have seemed to him like a
        person eating out of a dustbin. You know this isn&rsquo;t a real food place right? <br />
        Wendy&rsquo;s marketing synergy had long ago infected most all of Harry&rsquo;s thought processes, causing him
        to think of consumption even at totally inappropriate moments--for instance, the last time Harry saw his sister,
        Hermoine, he remarked how similar their names were to protagonists of the mega franchise spawned by J. K.
        Rowling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce.&rdquo; His mentioning it had caught his younger
        sister off guard, not because she&rsquo;d never noticed the resemblance herself, but because Harry had brought
        it up, quite loudly, in the middle of their parents&rsquo; funeral.</p>

    <p>Thin Todd pulled into the Wendy&rsquo;s parking lot. He wouldn&rsquo;t let another drive thru bitch safely height
        shame him from behind an intercom, so he lent Harry a shawl to cover his privates, and the two walked toward the
        beaming yellow-red establishment, Harry&rsquo;s bare feet bloodied and syringe-poked by the time they reached
        its entrance.<br />
        Harry adjusted his glasses to read the menu above the register counter:</p>

        Pooh &#21129;&#26313;&#27874;&#21160;&#24577;&#32593;&#33258;&#30001;&#38376; <br />
        <br />
        Feeling a squishy sense of deja vu, (or deja vu byproduct), Harry glanced over at Thin Todd, who read the menu
        intently, and whose glossy and void eyes suggested that he noticed capital-N Nothing out of the ordinary. <br />
        &ldquo;Do you ever feel like the movie of your life has started recycling stock footage?&rdquo; said Harry.
        <br />
        &ldquo;Recycling?&rdquo; Thin Todd turned from the menu to face Harry with a super-sized measure of hostility.
        &ldquo;What are you, little dude, some pussy-ass &lsquo;Save the Whales&rsquo; nigga?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Harry said nothing, but slunk back down into his ratty shawl. A healthy breeze from the restaurant&rsquo;s
        carcinogenic AC unit tickled his dangly parts. He shoved away the cranial tingle of mystery with a mental-stick,
        and ordered his Little-Guy Surprise Meal - a Junior Whopper complete with small-fry, small drink, and a toy: a
        limited-edition Tom Cruise action figure, meant to promote Cruise&rsquo;s upcoming grimace inducing vehicle,
        Mission Impissable X, Super Size Me Agent &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson.</p>

    <p>His friend ordered a smoothie (Mountain Dew-Infused &quot;Jingleberry&quot;) and three Wendy&rsquo;s vape pods.
        <br />
        &ldquo;Do you guys have the ATHEISM-flavored smoothie?&rdquo; His now atheist friend had asked beforehand,
        hopefully. <br />
        &ldquo;Sorry, sir&rdquo; the cashier had answered. &ldquo;We just ran out. A man in a fedora and a gleaming
        white suit of armour came in ten minutes ago and bought the last of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t stand in the same light as the cashier.<br />
        He was a tweenager, a gen-Z male still younger than Harry. A boy whose skin was wan and boogery - colorless
        under the fluorescence of the Wendy&rsquo;s interior lighting. Bits of dried cum clung to his face, to the
        wispy, xenoestrogen-stifled peach fuzzes on his upper lip. But Harry imagined that this boy&rsquo;s mother loved
        him anyhow, and this was the thought that occupied Harry&rsquo;s mind as he consumed his Little-Guy Surprise,
        sat in his shawl across from his now confirmed-as-atheist friend. Out the window he watched semi trucks merge
        lazily onto the freeway. </p>

    <p>*</p>

    <p>The boy woke sluggish. He raised his face from where it had stuck to the plasticky Wendy&rsquo;s paper, and
        hand-wiped the ketchup from his baby fat cheek. It was morning. A crisp and lightly-fogged morning, again
        looking out, a few semis parked sleeping along the shoulder.<br />
        His progressively ever-more atheist friend was nowhere in sight.</p>

    <p>Harry didn&rsquo;t panic, but scooped up a couple of the raggedy fries left from his dinner, and made breakfast
        by dipping them in the ketchup that had stuck to his cheek and forehead. <br />
        &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He exited Wendy&rsquo;s from the back kitchen door, after half an hour trying the front and side doors. Harry was
        not quite nude, Thin T odd having left the shawl on him, graciously, or perhaps forgetfully, but what Harry had
        gained in clothing he&rsquo;d more than lost in confidence. His newest friend had abandoned him. It would be
        another long and humiliating day of hitchhiking. </p>

    <p>The Ovum was scheduled to start within the week. He would have to ditch the shawl on the way, sure - but did he
        really want to, when it was the one token of kindness he&rsquo;d ever earned in his life? Now that Harry had
        tasted friendship, it seemed, his desire to prance with nude degenerates and cosplayers was in danger of falling
        by the wayside. Harry thought wistfully of the Sailor Moon costume he&rsquo;d made for last year&rsquo;s
        convention - though still a happy memory, it now felt strangely empty. </p>

    <p>*</p>

    <p>The Ovum, you&rsquo;ll recall, was a new-fangled Cosplay convention, sponsored by Onahole and Wendy&rsquo;s.
        Attendees to the Ovum are expected to arrive Completely Nude, which still continues to explain Harry&rsquo;s
        lack of clothing. <br />
        &ldquo;COLLABORATIVE NOVELS ARE the FUTURE OF PUNK LITERATURE,&rdquo; cried Stanley Winks, event organizer of
        the Ovum. &ldquo;AND Harry&rsquo;S JOURNEY BEING SYMBOLIC OF the SPERM&rsquo;S JOURNEY TO the OVUM, TO the EGG
        HATCHING LIFE ITSELF, I THINK THIS WHOLE MYSTERY HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR the &#8230; BIZARRE?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The old pervert lay in bed within his 2000 sq- foot McMansion, the site of the Ovum itself. The Tiananmen Square
        pasta flashed through Winks&rsquo; mental webs, his eyes pulsating with Matrix-esque descending lines of
        vertical techno babble. </p>

    <p>Winks both funded and hosted the event every year. It was a point of pride that pubescent and lithe boys such as
        Harry would arrive at his home, nude and dizzy with excitement. the Ovum was basically a Greek holiday, and
        Winks&rsquo; McMansion was the fucking symposium [eurobeat intensifies].</p>

    <p>Winks had made his fortune in biotechnology, doing contract work for AIPAC and Walmart. He patented a new series
        of mobile scooter devices, for use by the most obese and &ldquo;mobility-challenged&rdquo; consumers in the
        nation. Mobile scooting was where Winks&rsquo; genius lay, sure, but his genuine appetite was for boys such as
        Harry. His need had begun with the mysterious Chinese runes that Harry had witnessed the night before. That
        hadn&rsquo;t been the first time Harry saw the symbols - it was only a month earlier that Harry had been eating
        Alphabet soup, when the same Chinese text block appeared in his steamy bowl.<br />
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;GET ME the CFO OF MCDONALDS ON the PHONE&rsquo; Winks sputtered.<br />
        &ldquo;Right away, sir,&rdquo; purred his assistant, a faux-hawked LGBTQ+ &ldquo;person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you
        want her cell or landline?&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL TAKE IT IN the BEDROOM&rdquo; shouted Winks, without a hint of irony.<br />
        His assistant pressed a button on the massive switchboard at its desk. A series of alphanumeric LED characters
        crept across the monitor.<br />
        Damn. Simplified Chinese, again.</p>

    <p>A dial tone echoed from the house&rsquo;s PA system, then was abruptly cut off.<br />
        &ldquo;Mmmmmyellow?&rdquo; It was the female CFO of McDonald&rsquo;s - a newly appointed figurehead to divert
        the public&rsquo;s frustration from (((Them))). Her name was Downton Abbey, but instead of London, England she
        was from London, Missouri. Blonde. Forty-six years old. Five foot nine at home, Six foot two in her gov&rsquo;t
        mandated dominatrix heels - and at 165 lbs she was exactly as firm and authoritative as needed. </p>

    <p>Winks knew the bitch from college. Both were members of the Yale old-guard, and carried themselves accordingly.
        (Neither had ever eaten McDonalds in their lives yet harangued the public with promos and daily social media
        posts - managed, of course, by secretaries, handlers, interns who paid for the privilege, trying their hardest
        to depopulate the whites of <strong>burger</strong>land so a new race of rootless and toothless halflings could replace them and
        be marketed to nonstop and without question, across the homo globe.)</p>

    <p>It was the Chinamen again.<br />
        And Winks knew all too well what would come next.</p>

    <p>The message seared the backs of his eyes, blinding him temporarily as he roared and shrieked in pain. Covering
        his face, he fumbled about his bedroom for the phone receiver. the imprint of the text still flashed in his
        retinas, pulsating with the blood in his forehead - xenoestrogen deficient but adrenochrome rich. What is that
        &ldquo;- chrome&rdquo; stuff that they take from babies or w/e? I forget // (I think it&rsquo;s called vernix
        caseosa)<br />
        &ldquo;ABBEY!!!&rdquo; Winks screamed.<br />
        &ldquo;Yes, Stanley?&rdquo; she replied, entertaining his early morning insanity for the sake of their business
        acquaintanceship.<br />
        &ldquo;THE CHINKS, ABBEY, THEY&rsquo;RE HACKING the <strong>burger</strong>PUNK and STEALING MY BOY PUSSY!&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;What the Hell are you talking about,&rdquo; reproached Abbey, &ldquo; I really, well, uh, think the
        ADRENOCHROME has gotten to you. Have you taken your contra-pills this morning?&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;Darling, we all consume and torture-rape children,&rdquo; Stanley reminded her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
        already forgotten pizzagate?&rdquo; he asked, with the anachronistic foresight of the higher-level addict
        &ldquo;Talk about peak <strong>burger</strong>punk, eh? Anyway Abbey, have YOU taken YOUR pills?&rdquo;<br />
        Stanley&rsquo;s retort reminded Abbey that she&rsquo;d skipped her birth control for several days. &ldquo;Oh
        &#8230; rats!&rdquo; mewed the intimidating and green-eyed dominatrix, whose womb bulge belched (with love)~ She
        tapped a quickdial contact on her iPhaggot device: &ldquo;Planned Parenthood &#8230;&rdquo; </p>

    <p>It was past noon when Harry managed to flag down a ride. A late-model SUV with a stick figure family on the back
        windshield.<br />
        Harry noticed something unusual about the stick figure family: each member wore a Chinese-style rice paddy
        hat.<br />
        &ldquo;Ruh-roh,&rdquo; Harry gulped.<br />
        The family invited him into their sports utility vehicle, and he sat in the middle row, on a mound of hay,
        between two precocious Chinese children. One child played with an abacus, while the other caught flies with its
        chopsticks.<br />
        &ldquo;LOL,&rdquo; said Harry.<br />
        &ldquo;Ror where?&rdquo; replied the Father who drove extremely poorly. Harry suspected his eyes were opened but
        couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure.<br />
        Minutes passed that way.<br />
        Just as Harry became comfortable and things quieted, the family&rsquo;s dog leapt out happily from the back and
        into Harry&rsquo;s lap.<br />
        &ldquo;OH he rick you arr over!&rdquo; the Mother laughed. &ldquo;Teeheehee!&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you Chinamen kept pets,&rdquo; Harry said in between getting licked.<br />
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a pet,&rdquo; the father corrected him, sternly.</p>

    <p>Harry had been nervous about choosing a restaurant, since he didn&rsquo;t know what kind of food girls liked or
        didn&rsquo;t like. In the end, he had decided on a little French bistro&mdash;the only French restaurant in the
        whole development.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be a terrific choice. His date had ordered the escargot appetizer and saut&eacute;ed sweetbreads
        for a main course and loved them both. Harry himself was a little less adventurous, opting for vichyssoise and
        veal in a buttery herb sauce, but he was happy too.<br />
        The wine was a Chateau Picard &rsquo;88&mdash;a good year, according to their waiter. The Date had high praise
        for that as well. Harry just knew that the stuff made him light-headed. After dinner, he programmed his car to
        take them to a secluded spot in the hills that overlooked the town. The vehicle stopped in the field of a two
        hundred-year-old magnolia tree and Harry came around to open his Date&rsquo;s door.<br />
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite the gentleman,&rdquo; she observed.<br />
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a graduate of the <strong>burger</strong> University,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all quite the
        gentleman.&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;All?&rdquo; she trilled!<br />
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;we were all taught to be quite the same gentleman. I guess a few of us
        forget who he was from time to time.&rdquo;<br />
        &ldquo;This gentleman,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;What exactly was his name?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If Harry had been dumber he would have let his eyes narrow, or perhaps through a motion of the body or a twitch
        of the eyelid let on that this wasn&rsquo;t the sort of question an innocent all-American date really ought to
        be asking pre-coitus. It was the kind of question that made a fella&rsquo; switch genres and start ta&rsquo; ask
        himself what this broad was up to. I mean, what she was really up to, behind all the sweet talk and the shared
        complementary mayonnaise packets. The way she&rsquo;d got the snails out of their shells like she could have
        slaughtered invertebrates blindfold. Hell of a dame. Hell of a footgame.</p>

    <p>Harry took a draw on the hand-rolled cigarette that had found its way into his mouth and said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Look, sweetheart, there was quite the gentleman once, let&rsquo;s leave it at that. Now why don&rsquo;t we
        forget all that alma mater business and get down to brass tacks, shall we?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She swooned right onto the gearstick.</p>

    <p>*</p>

    <p>The following morning I was on video conference with execs from<br />
        <strong>burger</strong>King. Perhaps you know the company. Two years ago they caused a stir with their Marilyn Monroe
        commercials: the singular way the dead actress, standing over that same New York steam vent she made famous
        almost forty years ago, turns and invites the home viewer to try her brand of Onion Ring. Had <strong>burger</strong> King not
        won a seat in the Senate that year, the lawsuits would have buried the company then and there.</p>

    <p>The Onion Ring Association of America does not fuck around.<br />
