    <h2>üëéüçî - The Anti-<strong>burger</strong>punk Manifesto </h2>
    <p>How much more bourgeoise can a movement be than one so fixed on the life of the urbanite. How much more
        bourgeoise
        can a movement be than one which finds more narcissistic entertainment in the act of grabbing a mirror and
        observing
        oneself for hours. Oh, society! Oh, Mac‚Äôciety! A society? More like a thousand chimpanzees with typewriters, all
        dressed like Andy Warhol and force fed a diet of nothing but <strong>burger</strong>.</p>

    <p>NO innovation in this prose,</p>
    <p>NO important commentary,</p>
    <p>JUST SOME FRIEs</p>

    <p>And to prove the bourgeois nature of this movement, and prove it before the movement even starts, we shall
        observe
        the accident of the removal of character names in parts of the text: this movement tries to larp as subversive,
        attacking the common aesthetic, or the classical form of prose; but this ‚Äúattack‚Äù is superficial because we can
        only
        see a subversion in the management of the flow of the prose, which imitates what would otherwise be an internet
        discussion. The structure of the story however, which follows the character or their journey itself, is tied to
        the
        usual way of writing: a character that can be envisioned having a journey from point A to point B in a linear
        time/space progression.
        And when you show this to THEM, and truly subvert the structure of story by destroying the way to conceptualize
        a
        protagonist and giving them the same importance of any other word (as it should be) you get attacked by
        bourgeoise
        city intellectuals crying that their structure (the structure they seem to hate) has been truly subverted.</p>
    <p>You have revived the horror with your superficial pursuit of subversion, you have zombiefied
        <strong>burger</strong>punk.</p>

    <p>Nothing more to say, <strong>burger</strong>punk is dead and well.</p>
